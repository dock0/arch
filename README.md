A minimal Arch container, used as the baseline for my other containers. It used to contain the [amylum](https://github.com/amylum/repo) repo, but I've moved that to [dock0/static_arch](https://github.com/dock0/static_arch). If you want an Archlinux container that has the whole [base](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/base/) package group, check out [dock0/full_arch](https://github.com/dock0/full_arch).

## Usage
